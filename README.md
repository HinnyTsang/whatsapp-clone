Follow Tutorial from [Web Dev Simplfied](https://youtu.be/tBr-PybP_9c).

Using Socket.io and React to rebuild a simple messanger in the local host. Instead of directly follow the instructions from the video, we used TypeScript in this project as a practice and learning.

To start the application, please follow the following step.

1. Open the git terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/HinnyTsang/whatsapp-clone.git <Project Directory>` to download the files to your target `<Project Directory>`.

2. Open a terminal and call `cd <Project Directory>/client` to redirect to the client folder.

   - Call `npm start` to host the app in `localhost:3000`

3. Open a terminal and call `cd <Project Directory>/server` to redirect to the server folder.

   - Call `npm run devStart` to start the server.

4. Open any browser and direct to `http://localhost:3000/` to start a new conversation!.
